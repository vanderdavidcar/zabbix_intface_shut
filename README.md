# Disclaimer
I'm not a dev yet, this is NOT fancy code. It does work (for me at least!) though. You can seriously mess up your producition environment with my scripts if you don't know what you're doing. I take no responsibility for that :)</br>


## Modules

Two functions to help identify all interfaces DOWN exported on zabbix .csv file and create script to shutdwon interces in a produtction environment
